# Interview Algorithms WarmUp

I did this repo, for my personal training in Go, and also to help others that are new to this process, feel free to comment or reach out, I hope you pass your job interview! You can make it!


In this repo you will find excercises from the book "Cracking the code interview", "HackerRank", "Leetcode" and some interviews that I had.
