# Golang | Algorithms, Interviews and more

I did this repo, for my personal training in Go, and also to help others that are new to learn a new language or to warm up for your next interview, feel free to comment or reach out, I hope you pass your job interview if that's the case! You can make it!


In this repo you will find excercises from the book "Cracking the code interview", "HackerRank", "Leetcode" and some interviews that I had, and others exams that I saw on Glassdoor regarding interviews.
